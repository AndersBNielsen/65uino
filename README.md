# Welcome to the 65uino project

It's a green 6502 based learning platform in a familiar form factor and a contestant in the 2023 Hackaday Prize. By taking IC's out of the waste stream and into useful products we encourage recycling and reuse.

In this repository you will find KiCAD hardware files, gerbers and 6502 ASM source files for the 65uino.
The 65uino is based on the Single Breadboard Computer - https://youtu.be/s3t2QMukBRs

You'll find more details at https://hackaday.io/project/190260-65uino

Prerequisites:

Install cc65 (and minipro if using a tl866II+ to program a ROM) using your favorite package manager
Run assemble.sh to assemble the source file
(If you use Windows you probably want to use WSL for this^)

The hardware schematic was created using KiCAD 6
